      <h1>Murder at Midnight</h1>
      <h3>By Avi</h3>

        In the book <i>Murder at Midnight</i> by Avi, the main conflict all starts when these papers written in the exact same way are distributed throughout Pergamontio, Italy. These papers talked about how there needed to be change and that the current king, King Claudio, is ruling the city weakly. The papers then say "The kingdom needs a strong ruler! Establish true authority! Do not fear change!"

          Some background context, in <i>Murder at Midnight</i>, the city of Pergamontio does not have printers, printing presses, etc. This is why when the papers that looked <b>exactly</b> the same started spreading around the city, it freaked the king and everyone else out. In this excerpt, the main character, Fabrizio, meets this girl who came from a different city with her parents. Her parents brought with them a printing press, one of the first ones to ever come into Pergamontio. Fabrizio, gets confused about what a printing press is since he’s never heard of one before. “‘I suppose you think it’s easy to use a printing press?’ Fabrizio stared blankly at the girl. ‘What’s a...a...pant...presser?’ ‘A...printing...press!’ said the girl with loud, overstated slowness, as if Fabrizio were hard of hearing”(121). Fabrizio’s confusion is obvious as he learns about a printing press for the first time, even mispronouncing it and confusing it with pants, “What’s a...a...pant...presser?” This city doesn’t even have a printing press but a bunch of duplicate papers is enough to put everyone in the city at edge. With Count Scarazoni (One of King Claudio’s men) filling up the city streets with his soldiers. “But the streets were full of Count Scarazoni’s green-coated soldiers. Armed with pikes and swords, they dispersed every gathering they came upon”(61) If such harsh actions are taken against a bunch of duplicate papers, imagine what a website and the internet could do. Especially with the ability to send/share “posts” and websites in seconds, with less than 2 clicks. Just copy the URL of the website, and send it to your friend. Sharing and spreading information has never been easier than it is right now, and with the internet, it could be devastating to the city of Pergamontio, since they sent out a large amount of soldiers into the city to patrol for trouble over a bunch of cloned papers. If the city suddenly gained access to power, and internet, and then something like <i>this</i> happened, it could increase the conflict by a drastic amount. This city just got access to an overwhelming number of information, and a website like this with plots to overthrow the current king show up. It could, possibly, in King Claudio’s eyes, look like a long and well thought out plot to finally overthrow him and his family, that or a huge coincidence that this thing called the “internet” just showed up as well as a “website” detailing the dethroning of him.
